SWERVIN' MERVIN'

A recreation of 80's-style pseudo-3D arcade racing games.

Accelleration and steering are performed by integrating with a LEAP Motion Controller.

I owe a lot to to Jake at codeincomplete.com and Lou at extentofthejam.com as pseudo-3d games development really pushed my mathematical boundaries. Without their fantastic articles I would have failed miserably!
